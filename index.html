  <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web
    resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/),
     which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.
    [1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP),
     may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.
     The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.
